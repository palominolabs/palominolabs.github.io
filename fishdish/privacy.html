<p>
  This Privacy Policy describes how and when Palomino collects, uses and shares your information, per your express submission, when you use our Service. When using our Service, you consent to the collection, transfer, manipulation, storage, disclosure and other uses of your information as described in this Privacy Policy. Irrespective of which country you reside in or supply information from, you authorize Palomino to use your information in the United States and any other country where Palomino operates. Here are the key things to know about our privacy practices:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>We don&#39;t collect personal information from Mobile App users.</li>
</ul>
<p>Please read on for all the details.</p>
<h3>Information Collection</h3>
<p>
  We refer to information about your use of the Service (e.g., timing of usage, frequency of plays, etc., but not personally identifiable information), whether collected by or created by our servers, in this policy as &quot;<b>Usage Information</b>&quot;.  Usage Information may include, for example, your device and mobile operating system specifications for the Mobile App.
</p>
<h3>Use of Information</h3>
<p>
  The information gathered through the Service, including information that identifies you or your device is used to compile reports that are used to adjust parameters of the game (e.g. difficulty) for all users.
</p>
<h3>Sharing of Information</h3>
<p>
  Palomino does not share or sell personal information about a user with third parties except as specifically described in this policy. We may share this information internally among our employees, contractors, or affiliates in the normal course of business. We may share your information with unaffiliated third parties in the case of &quot;<b>Business Transactions</b>&quot;, &quot;<b>Service Providers</b>&quot; or &quot;<b>Legal Requests</b>&quot;
</p>
<h4>Business Transactions</h3>
<p>
  If Palomino is involved in a bankruptcy, merger, acquisition, reorganization or sale of assets, your information may be sold or transferred as part of that transaction. The promises in this Privacy Policy will apply to your information as transferred to the new entity.
</p>
<h4>Service Providers</h3>
<p>
  We may use third parties to provide back-end services to us in connection with the Service and such parties may have access to information we gather through the Services. For example, we use third party analytics services to track and analyze usage of our Service.
</p>
<h4>Legal Requests</h3>
<p>
  We may share information gathered in connection with your use of the Service with a court of law, governmental agency or other governmental body from any jurisdiction upon their request. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Policy, we may preserve or disclose your information if we believe that it is reasonably necessary to comply with a law, regulation or legal request; to protect the safety of any person; to address fraud, security or technical issues; or to protect Palomino&#39;s rights or property. However, nothing in this Policy is intended to limit any legal defenses or objections that you may have to a third party&#39;s, including a government&#39;s, request to disclose your information.
</p>
<p>
  We may share or disclose your non-private, aggregated or otherwise non-personal information in order to conduct our normal business operations, in our sole discretion.

The most current version of the policy will govern our use of your information and will always be at <a href="http://ghpages.palominolabs.com/fishdish/privacy.html">http://ghpages.palominolabs.com/fishdish/privacy.html</a>.
